# mortgage-calculator
Simple fixed rate mortgage calculator for personal finances. Made for my own use, but still fairly user-friendly. Calculates payments during and after the initial term, incorporating the Bank of England base rate and any overpayments.

The main utility is in the Jupyter notebook file mortgage-calculator.ipynb.
